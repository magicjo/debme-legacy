`debme` is a simple project to deploy my *debian* environment.

## Install

To install/uninstall `debme` in your computer, you need to have the `make` software (`apt-get install --yes make`) and the right access to edit the directories `/opt` and `/usr/local/bin` (`root`).

To install or update, you have just to run
```bash
make install
```

To uninstall, you have just to run
```bash
make uninstall
```

## Test
